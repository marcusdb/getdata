clone this repository locally

run RStudio and open the run_analysis.R file (which is inside the git cloned folder)

in RStudio: setwd("[DATA_FOLDER]")  -- complete path

The script will run and create the tidy data file named tidyData.txt in the [DATA_FOLDER] and will create averageTidyData.txt in the same folder as well
